There are birds who fly by night
and some who love the day
but i know a bird
who eats hay.

This is really super. 

This is a competing rhyme stanza 
I want to see a red panda
If I go to the show
Can you please tell Flo
I never liked George Constanza

Rainy nights plotting paintings
wondering why the sailboats rock
then I eat a meatball hoagie
and go to sleep
